                            1.  INTRODUCTION

1.1.    Abstract
    This document describes the fundamentals of the r-type protocol, for
    the server as well as the client. Both of them run on the UDP protocol.

    For its implmeentation we used 'asio', a cross-platform C++ library for network
    and low-level I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent
    asynchronous model using a modern C++ approach.


1.2.    Context
    R-Type game is informally called a Horizontal Shmup (e.g. Shoot’em’up),
    and while R-Type is not the first one of its category, this one has been a
    huge success amongst gamers in the 90’s, and had several ports, spin-offs,
    and 3D remakes on modern systems.

    This particular R-Type is homemade, and includes a twist not featured in
    the original game (nor in the remakes by the way): it will be a network
    game, where one-to-four players will be able to fight together evil!


1.3.    Status of This memo
    This memo is the official specification of the r-type protocol.
    Distribution of this memo is unlimited.



                        2.  SENDING AND RECEIVING DATA

2.1.    Asynchronous
    Using the asio library for our UDP implementation, we want to handle asynchornous
    operations. For that, the io_context class also includes facilities intended
    for developers of custom asynchronous services.

    Synchronous operations on I/O objects implicitly run the io_context object
    for an individual operation. The io_context functions run(), or its variations
    must be called for the io_context to perform asynchronous operations on behalf
    of a C++ program. Notification that an asynchronous operation has completed
    is delivered by invocation of the associated handler.
    Handlers are invoked only by a thread that is currently calling any overload
    of run(), run_one(), run_for(), run_until(), poll() or poll_one() for the
    io_context.


2.2.    MultiThreading
    Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system to enable
    more than one user at a time without requiring multiple copies of the program
    running on the computer. Multithreading can also handle multiple requests
    from the same user.

    In our case, it will be used for the handling of many clients on the server.
    So the server is multithreaded but each client is not. It handles multiple
    requests at the same time thanks to the implementation of threads.


2.3.    Header
    A UDP datagram consists of a datagram header followed by a data section
    (the payload data for the application). The UDP datagram header consists of
    4 fields, each of which is 2 bytes (16 bits):[1]
    For reminder, this is what a standard UDP header looks like:

         0                   1                   2                   3
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |           Source port         |       Destination port        |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |              Length           |           Checksum            |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |                                                               :
        :                            Payload                            :
        :                                                               |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        On top of this header, we will be using one of our own. It is designed to
        simplify the reading of the following data packet. With this complementary 
        header we are able to detail more precisely its content using two
        variables, the first one will be the type of packet following and the 
        second its size.

        We implemented it using structures, so it is part of the same datagram
        as the body. This is how it looks like:

        struct my_packet {
            // header fields
            uint16_t _type;
            uint16_t _size;

            // body fields
            struct my_datagram;
        };

                            4.  CONNECTION

4.1.    Establishing a Connection
    The connection is established via Linux UDP Sockets, using the asio library.

    By definition, UDP is connection-less protocol. 'Connecting' a UDP socket
    is simply a convenience operation, which allows you to than send datagrams
    on that socket without specifying recipient - it uses the one you gave to a
    connect call.

    But other than that, it does nothing. There is really no way to check if
    someone is listening on the other side of UDP, unless you implement a
    request/response scheme yourself.

    Note: the fact that we are using asio adds nothing to this basic fact.


4.2.    Normal Closure
    This section defines closure events that are qualified as 'normal', it means
    that they are meant ti be happening. We will detail client and server side in
    the following sections.

    Since there is no official connection, therefore no closure with UDP, we will
    refer as closure as the end of receiving and sending packets. Either from a
    user interaction or a network event. 

4.2.1.   Client Initiated Closure
    A client will be able to close a connection by interactions with its interface
    either by using the close function of the window, or killing the process in
    the terminal (usually a CTRL + C command)

4.2.2.  Server Initiated Closure
    There is only one way for the server to voluntarilly iniate a closure event,
    by killing the process running in the terminal, like above usually using a 
    CTRL + C command or a kill -9 <process_id>


4.3.    Non Normal Closures
    This section attempts to offer details around non normal closure. These 
    events are not handled by the code and maybe not be easily solvable. 

    If you encounter one we suggest you to attempt again and if it fails 
    please see the section 'What to do ?'

4.3.1   Examples
    error: udp connect failed: Cannot assign requested address for 242.43.1.32 port 53

    This one is pretty strait-forward, it means that the address you are trying
    to reach is not available, you may want to verify your source or target.

    Keep in mind that most error thrown may be sovable, if you encounter one that
    seems to be unhandled (some segmentation fault obviously)

4.3.2.   What to do ?
    Do not panic !
